### Introduction
Bring your beloved food constructs and kitchen creativity wherever you go with the Recipe Book App: a sleek and simple iOS application that helps manage your very own recipes. The app is a frictionless way to save your recipes to your device without the constraints of a physical book-keep. With itâ€™s elegant design comes many quality-of-life features such as recipe conversions to different servings, ease of recipe editing, and the ability to sort through your recipes in a quick and efficient manner. The Recipe Book will catalyze your time spent preparing for your everyday cravings and allow you to enjoy your creations sooner. 


### Recipe Tab
Displays all the recipes created by the current user with the option to add and delete recipes. Each recipe cell displays the basic information for the recipe: recipe name, serving size, prep time, and an image representing the recipe category. When the user taps on a recipe, they will be directed to the recipe view screen. Likewise, when the user taps on the add (+) button, they will be directed to the add recipe screen.

### Converter Tab
Users select a recipe from the dropdown to convert (or pre-filled if the user clicked convert on a recipe) to populate the screen with the recipe details. Serving conversion text field contains a placeholder displaying the current serving size. Users can edit the serving size and click the scale button to convert the recipe ingredients temporarily. Converting a recipe will not update the current recipe in the database.

### New Recipe Screen
Compact UI for users to enter the name, recipe type, serving size, prep time, and ingredients of a new recipe. Users are required to fill all required fields for a new recipe. Pressing save persists the recipe into the Core Data of the app and brings the user back to the Recipes tab where the new recipe can be found.

Users can edit the current recipe by tapping the edit button which will direct them to the add/edit screen with pre filled information. Users also have the option to convert the current recipe on a larger/smaller scale by tapping the convert button which will redirect them to the converter screen. The converter screen will display the recipe and its current serving size.
